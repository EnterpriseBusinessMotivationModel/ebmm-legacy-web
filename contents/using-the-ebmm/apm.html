<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In 2007, Microsoft IT realized that it had a problem.  There were thousands of applications running, and the relationships between them were complex.  Keeping the entire portfolio of applications running required full time care and feeding and any change to an operating system or a new browser meant months of testing to make sure that the whole framework wouldn’t come crashing down around our ankles.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I was in the Enterprise Architecture team, and volunteered to be part of the effort to reduce the number of applications through a process we termed “portfolio rationalization.”  The goal was to remove redundant systems, obsolete systems, and systems that were unusually expensive to keep maintained.  Our challenge was to find these overlapping critters among thousands of systems.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A huge part of the problem — no single person knew every system.  In fact, for the majority of systems, no single person knew the entire system.  Documentation was often sparse or would describe technical details (how to install and configure it) but not functional details (what it did, who it was for, and why it needs to exist).  The latter information would have to be hand crafted from the knowledge of a broad array of people and, in some cases, from simply digging through the system itself (documentation, code, data, references, etc).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was an Application Portfolio Management (APM) challenge of epic proportions, and we addressed it with a novel method… or at least we tried to.  To be completely honest, at the time I was a relatively young Enterprise Architect and didn’t understand change management and how to convince people to use novel methods.  So while two of us (Gabriel Morgan and myself, Nick Malik) created a method called “Solution Domains,” based on a taxonomy of systems, and created nice PowerPoint decks to explain it, it didn’t catch on.  So many lessons learned since that day!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The method is sound, and I stand behind it.  Unfortunately, the effort at Microsoft,  at that time, reduced to “shooting the low hanging fruit.”  In other words, finding apps with very few people willing to defend the app, challenging it’s need to exist, and if no one screamed, deleting it.  There was some effort made to replace really old apps with more modern ones, but those efforts were expensive and not necessarily fruitful.  No, the real portfolio rationalization wasn’t all that rational.  But it worked.  Microsoft managed to cut the sheer size of it’s Application Portfolio in half.  Good work.</span></p>
<h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>So what was this method based on Solution Domains?</b></span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We start with a taxonomy of systems and a definition useful for creating that taxonomy.  We then map each system to one (or a handful) of elements in that taxonomy.  Then we navigate through the taxonomy, assigning groups of systems to individual architects. Those architects are responsible for understanding all of the systems in their domain, and proposing methods for rationalizing that part of the portfolio.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s a fairly simple method.  The effort failed on the part where we assign architects to domains.  The company had already assigned project managers to own completely different portfolios of applications (grouped by company silo, not by functionality or data assets).  Result: systems with the loudest executives survived while systems with quiet (or new) execs were deleted.   What can I say?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Regardless, here is the taxonomy.  Perhaps it can be effectively used somewhere by someone.  It is no longer in use in Microsoft.</span></p>
