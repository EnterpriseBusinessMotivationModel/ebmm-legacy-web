# Ontology – Business Model Assessment Viewpoint
This set of terms are related to the concerns of individuals who must assess a business model for strengths and weaknesses as well as the forces that influence whether that business model are likely to succeed.  Many of the terms relevant to this area are shared terms, and appear in that list instead.

This viewpoint illustrates the relationship of a business model assessment to the rest of the elements of the business motivation model.  Business model assessments can be performed either by internal parties or external parties. By documenting the assessment in the model, we illustrate two things.  A) an assessment is not, by itself, a driver. Assessments do not force change. However, an assessment can be the justification for change.

This assessment is fundamentally different from the assessment of capability maturity.  A business model assessment is designed to show the business how their models work in the marketplace.  They are external in focus and may question the structure of an existing business model.  A capability assessment is designed to show how well the organization is aligned to fulfil the model. A capability assessment does not question that the business should have a particular model, but rather how well the company can perform it.
